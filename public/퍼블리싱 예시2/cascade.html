  <body>
    <h1 class="main-heading">Hello World.</h1>

    <p>
      As the body has been set to have a color of blue this is inherited through
      the descendants.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can change the color by targeting the element with a selector, such as
      this
      <span>span</span>.
